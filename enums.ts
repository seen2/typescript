// Enums
// Enums are one of the few features TypeScript has which is not a type-level extension of JavaScript.
// Enums allow a developer to define a set of named constants. Using enums can make it easier to document intent, or create a set of distinct cases. TypeScript provides both numeric and string-based enums.

enum Direction {
  Up = 1,
  Down,
  Left,
  Right,
}
